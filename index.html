	<h1>+N License</h1>
	<h2>About</h2>
	<div>The +N License is a license modifier that requires the inclusion of the letter "N" in the LICENSE file.</div>
	<h2>Why?</h2>
	<div>By including the letter "N" in a LICENSE file that must be distributed with the software you will ensure:</div>
	<ul>
		<li>The software will not be used or hosted by western corporations that promote censorship</li>
		<li>The software will not be used or hosted by compromised individuals that promote censorship</li>
		<li>Users of the software will be immune to attacks that would result in censorship of others</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>How?</h2>
	<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Include the following text in any compatible LICENSE file:</div>
	<code>The above copyright notice, this permission notice and the letter "N" shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.</code>
	<h2>Example Licenses</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="AGPL-3.0-only+N.txt">AGPL-3.0-only+N</a></li>
		<li><a href="MIT+N.txt">MIT+N</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>FAQ</h2>
	<h3>Do I need to include "N" in my code?</h3>
	<div>No, the inclusion of the LICENSE file is enough. The +N modifier has no legal significance for any license that already requires redistribution of the LICENSE file.</div>
	<h3>Why "N"?</h3>
	<div>The letter "N" was chosen as it is deemed heretical in the west regardless (or lack) of context.</div>
	<h3>Can I add +N to licenses that don't require LICENSE file redistribution?</h3>
	<div>This is discouraged since it would result in +N having legal significance.</div>
	<h3>Is +N compatible with (A)GPL?</h3>
	<div>Inclusion of additional legal notices is allowed under ยง7(b) of the (A)GPL assuming they do not infringe on any of the freedoms granted to the user by the license.</div>
	<h3>What if someone removes the modifier?</h3>
	<div>Cancel them on Twitter for using code derived from heresy.</div>
